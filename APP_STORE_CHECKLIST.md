# 🚀 RackOff App Store Submission Checklist

Complete guide for submitting RackOff to the Mac App Store.

This is not the active project status. Use `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `TESTING.md` until the product/testing pass and Preferences cleanup are complete.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Apple Developer Account
- [ ] Enrolled in Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
- [ ] Account in good standing
- [ ] Access to App Store Connect

### 2. Developer Certificates
```bash
# Check your signing identities
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

You need the certificate for the distribution path:
- [ ] **Apple Distribution** or **Mac App Distribution** certificate (for Mac App Store)
- [ ] **Developer ID Application** certificate (only for direct downloads outside the Mac App Store)

**Get certificates:**
1. Go to [Apple Developer Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list)
2. Create the Apple Distribution or Mac App Distribution certificate for App Store work
3. Download and install in Keychain Access

### 3. App Store Connect Setup
- [ ] Create app record in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
- [ ] Bundle ID: `com.pablo.rackoff`
- [ ] App name: "RackOff - Desktop Cleaner" (or "RackOff" if available)
- [ ] SKU: `rackoff-v1` (internal identifier)

---

## Phase 1: Code Compliance ✅

### Previously Completed, Revalidate Before Submission:
- ✅ Sandboxed with proper entitlements
- ✅ Privacy manifest (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy)
- ✅ Usage descriptions for file access
- ✅ No deprecated APIs
- ✅ Memory-safe code
- ✅ Hardened runtime flags set

### Remaining:
- [ ] **Create app icon** - See `ICON_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - Need 1024x1024 PNG source
  - Generate .icns with all resolutions
  - Add to build script
- [ ] **Test sandbox behavior**
  - Verify file access prompts work
  - Test Desktop/Documents/Downloads access
  - Ensure security-scoped bookmarks persist

---

## Phase 2: Build & Sign

### Update Signing Identity

1. Open `build.sh`
2. Find line: `CODESIGN_IDENTITY="-"`
3. Replace it with the right certificate for the distribution path:
   ```bash
   # Mac App Store examples:
   CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Distribution: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
   CODESIGN_IDENTITY="3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"

   # Direct distribution outside the Mac App Store:
   CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
   ```

### Build for Distribution

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf RackOff.app

# Build with the selected distribution certificate
./build.sh
```

### Verify Signing

```bash
# Check signature
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 RackOff.app

# Check Gatekeeper will accept it
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose RackOff.app

# Verify entitlements
codesign -d --entitlements - RackOff.app
```

Expected output: `satisfies its Designated Requirement`

---

## Phase 3: Direct Distribution Notarization

Apple requires notarization for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store. This is not the Mac App Store upload path.

### Create App-Specific Password

1. Go to [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com)
2. Sign in → Security section
3. Generate "App-Specific Password" for notarization
4. Save it securely

### Notarize the App

```bash
# Create a ZIP of the app
ditto -c -k --keepParent RackOff.app RackOff.zip

# Submit for notarization
xcrun notarytool submit RackOff.zip \
  --apple-id "your-email@example.com" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  --wait

# If successful, staple the notarization ticket
xcrun stapler staple RackOff.app
```

**Track notarization:**
```bash
# Get submission ID from previous command, then:
xcrun notarytool info <submission-id> \
  --apple-id "your-email@example.com" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
```

---

## Phase 4: App Store Assets

### Required Screenshots

Need 3-5 screenshots for Mac App Store listing:

**Sizes Required:**
- 1280 x 800 px (or higher, 16:10 aspect ratio)

**Screenshot Ideas:**
1. **Main popover** - Show the clean button and file type toggles
2. **Before/After desktop** - Messy desktop → clean desktop
3. **Preferences window** - Show customization options
4. **Organization modes** - Quick Archive, Sort by Type, Smart Clean
5. **Menu bar integration** - Show the sparkles icon in menu bar

**Capture Screenshots:**
```bash
# Use built-in screenshot tool (Cmd+Shift+4)
# Or for specific window:
Cmd+Shift+5 → Select window

# Resize if needed
magick input.png -resize 2560x -quality 90 output.png
```

See `~/Documents/reference/WORKFLOW-screenshot-standards.md` for processing.

### Marketing Copy

**App Name:** RackOff

**Subtitle:** (30 characters max)
"Desktop chaos? Not anymore."

**Description:** (4000 characters max - use README.md content)
```
Your desktop's chaos nemesis. Finally.

You know that desktop situation? The one where screenshots multiply like rabbits and random PDFs just... appear?

RackOff swoops in, sorts it all into tidy dated folders, then gets out of your way. One click. Desktop's clean. You're back to work (or whatever).

THREE WAYS TO ORGANIZE
• Quick Archive – everything into daily folders
• Sort by Type – files find their tribes
• Smart Clean – you decide what goes where

WHAT IT HANDLES
• Screenshots that pile up during debugging
• Documents that drift in from who knows where
• Media files having a party on your desktop
• Archives that seemed important last Tuesday

SCHEDULING OPTIONS
• Manual (when the mood strikes)
• On launch (fresh start every time)
• Daily at 9 AM (set it and forget it)

Everything lands safe in Documents/Archive/[organized by date or type]
Nothing's deleted. Just... relocated.

NO BS INCLUDED
• No accounts to make
• No cloud to feed
• No AI watching
• Just a clean desktop when you need one

Built in Bangkok with plenty of coffee and mild frustration at my own desktop.

**Keywords:** (100 characters max)

**Promotional Text:** (170 characters max - editable without review)
