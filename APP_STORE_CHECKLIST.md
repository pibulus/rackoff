## Phase 1: Code Compliance âœ…

### Already Completed:
- âœ… Sandboxed with proper entitlements
- âœ… Privacy manifest (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy)
- âœ… Usage descriptions for file access
- âœ… No deprecated APIs
- âœ… Memory-safe code
- âœ… Hardened runtime flags set

### Remaining:

- [ ] **Test sandbox behavior**
  - Verify file access prompts work
  - Test Desktop/Documents/Downloads access
  - Ensure security-scoped bookmarks persist

---

## Phase 2: Build & Sign

### Update Developer ID

1. Open `build.sh`
2. Find line: `CODESIGN_IDENTITY="-"`
3. Replace with your Developer ID:
   ```bash
   CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
   ```

### Build for Distribution

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf RackOff.app

# Build with your Developer ID
./build.sh
```

### Verify Signing

```bash
# Check signature
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 RackOff.app

# Check Gatekeeper will accept it
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose RackOff.app

# Verify entitlements
codesign -d --entitlements - RackOff.app
```

Expected output: `satisfies its Designated Requirement`

## Phase 3: Notarization

Apple requires notarization for all apps distributed outside the App Store. This validates your app doesn't contain malware.

### Create App-Specific Password

1. Go to [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com)
2. Sign in â†’ Security section
3. Generate "App-Specific Password" for notarization
4. Save it securely

### Notarize the App

```bash
# Create a ZIP of the app
ditto -c -k --keepParent RackOff.app RackOff.zip

# Submit for notarization
xcrun notarytool submit RackOff.zip \
  --apple-id "your-email@example.com" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  --wait

# If successful, staple the notarization ticket
xcrun stapler staple RackOff.app
```

**Track notarization:**
```bash
# Get submission ID from previous command, then:
xcrun notarytool info <submission-id> \
  --apple-id "your-email@example.com" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
```

### Marketing Copy

**App Name:** RackOff

**Subtitle:** (30 characters max)
"Desktop chaos? Not anymore."

**Description:** (4000 characters max - use README.md content)
```
Your desktop's chaos nemesis. Finally.

You know that desktop situation? The one where screenshots multiply like rabbits and random PDFs just... appear?

RackOff swoops in, sorts it all into tidy dated folders, then gets out of your way. One click. Desktop's clean. You're back to work (or whatever).

THREE WAYS TO ORGANIZE
â€¢ Quick Archive â€“ everything into daily folders
â€¢ Sort by Type â€“ files find their tribes
â€¢ Smart Clean â€“ you decide what goes where

WHAT IT HANDLES
â€¢ Screenshots that pile up during debugging
â€¢ Documents that drift in from who knows where
â€¢ Media files having a party on your desktop
â€¢ Archives that seemed important last Tuesday

SCHEDULING OPTIONS
â€¢ Manual (when the mood strikes)
â€¢ On launch (fresh start every time)
â€¢ Daily at 9 AM (set it and forget it)

Everything lands safe in Documents/Archive/[organized by date or type]
Nothing's deleted. Just... relocated.

NO BS INCLUDED
â€¢ No accounts to make
â€¢ No cloud to feed
â€¢ No AI watching
â€¢ Just a clean desktop when you need one

Built in Bangkok with plenty of coffee and mild frustration at my own desktop.
