# RackOff ✨

Your desktop's chaos nemesis. Finally.

## What it does

You know that desktop situation? The one where screenshots multiply like rabbits and random PDFs just... appear?

RackOff swoops in, sorts it all into tidy dated folders, then gets out of your way.  
One click. Desktop's clean. You're back to work (or whatever).

**Three ways to organize your chaos:**
- Quick Archive → everything into daily folders
- Sort by Type → files find their tribes  
- Smart Clean → you decide what goes where

## Get it running

```bash
# Build it
./build.sh

# Install it  
cp -r RackOff.app /Applications/

# Use it
Click the sparkles in your menu bar
```

## How it works

Toggle what bugs you:
- Screenshots that pile up during debugging sessions
- Documents that drift in from who knows where
- Media files having a party on your desktop
- Archives that seemed important last Tuesday

Pick your cleaning vibe:
- Manual (when the mood strikes)
- On launch (fresh start every time)
- Daily at 9 AM (set it and forget it exists)

Everything lands safe in `~/Documents/Archive/[organized by date or type]`  
Nothing's deleted. Just... relocated.

## The deal

RackOff does one thing: it cleans your desktop without making it weird.

Want to customize? Right-click file types in Smart Clean mode.  
Bored of sparkles? Right-click the menu bar icon for options.  
Miss that one file? It's chilling in the Archive folder.

No accounts to make. No cloud to feed. No AI watching.  
Just a clean desktop when you need one.

Built in Bangkok with plenty of coffee and mild frustration at my own desktop.
