# RackOff ✨

Clean desktop. Clear mind. Done.

## What it does

Racks off desktop clutter into dated archives.  
Pick your style. Click once. Desktop's clean.

**Three ways to organize:**
- Quick Archive → daily folders
- Sort by Type → file-kind folders  
- Smart Clean → custom destinations

## Get it running

```bash
# Build
./build.sh

# Install
cp -r RackOff.app /Applications/

# Run
Click the sparkles in your menu bar
```

## How it works

Toggle what to clean:
- Screenshots that pile up
- Documents that drift
- Media that multiplies
- Archives that accumulate

Pick when to clean:
- Manual (you decide)
- On launch (auto-start)
- Daily at 9 AM (set and forget)

Files land in `~/Documents/Archive/[organized]`

## The deal

RackOff does one thing: desktop cleaning with attitude.

Want fancier organization modes? Right-click file types in Smart Clean.  
Want different icons? Right-click the menu bar sparkles.  
Want your desktop back? Check the Archive folder.

No accounts. No cloud. No judgment.  
Just a clean desktop when you need it.
